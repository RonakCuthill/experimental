## Marginalia API

Marginalia is an application for keeping notes and journals, particularly for
sofware developers. It wouldn't be much use without an API, right? The
Marginalia API is fully RESTful and uses JSON throughout.

### Authentication

Each request needs to be authenticated using your Marginalia username and password in the HTTP Basic Authorization header. All requests to Marginalia need to be made over HTTPS. `POST` requests should be made as the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type.
