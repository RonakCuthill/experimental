Starting in 1999, November has been considered [National Novel Writing Month](http://www.nanowrimo.org) (NaNoWriMo). Organized over the Internet, writers from across the globe are encouraged to write an entire novel in just 30 days. While the concept might seem far fetched, over 200,000 people have participated annually in recent years. Some novels have gone on to become quite popular; The Night Circus, by Erica Morgenstern, spent time on the New York Times Best Seller List, and the Sara Gruen's Water For Elephants was made into a movie.

The biggest challenge for participants is motivation and proper organization. While all 200,000 participants start the month intending to finish their novels, most people fail to meet the 50,000-word target. However, there are a number of success stories, and proper preparation can greatly increase one's chances of success. The best way to start off the right way is to use a NaNoWriMo app.

[Marginalia](https://www.marginaia.io/) is a great option. Novel-writers will want to ensure that they properly organize their thoughts. Writing a novel involves carefully planning characters, events and the flow of the story. Once these properties are properly dealt with, writing can begin. Many, however, have trouble keeping their thoughts and ideas organized properly. Here, [Marginalia](https://www.marginaia.io/) shines as a NaNoWriMo app; the novel-planning process is often disorganized, and writers must properly categorize disparate thoughts quickly. Marginalia's interface is great for dealing with this information.

In addition, writing a novel requires considerable motivation. Part of the goal of NaNoWriMo is to give writers a definite deadline to help them maintain sufficient motivation. Again, [Marginalia](https://www.marginaia.io/) has tools to help. Work requires setting goals and planning one's actions, and Marginalia has to-do list features that enable users to set the days' goals and check them off as they are accomplished. Combined with its note-taking functionality, Marginalia is a great NaNoWriMo app for participants.

NaNoWriMo has been hailed as a tremendous success, and the online support writers will receive is substantial. All participants are encouraged to take all steps possible to help them reach their goals, and using Marginalia can assist in many of the crucial aspects of successfully completing a novel.
