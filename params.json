I suppose I'm nerdy in some ways, as well.\r\n\r\n### Favorite Things\r\nHmm...my favorite book is Ender's Game, my favorite movie is Big Hero 6, my favorite song is \"On Top of the World\" by Greek Fire, my favorite band is Paramore, and my favorite store is H&M. I also quite enjoy eating at Chipotle and Pinkberry.\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nSharon Lin (@sharon-lin) is fairly quirky and likes banana smoothies.\r\n\r\n### Contact information\r\nHaha, I'll figure this out later.
